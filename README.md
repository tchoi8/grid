Introductory Coding workshop for Nehemiah Korea Daum School in Seoul. "NKgo Daum School Academy is an academic facility created solely to educate and foster North Korean students." - [Daum School](http://nkgobridge.weebly.com/) 

I was invited by the US Embassy in Seoul to lead a one day workshop for students between age of 17~27. Most of them are defectors/refugees from North Korea, who've relocated in Seoul very recently. Some of them are from North Korean diaspora, born in China or other countries by North Korean parents.   
 
The workshop followed curriculum I developed for Uncertainty School and Signing Coders. I asked Taekyung and Yumi from Stuckyi studio to help with teaching. It was once again a great experience to work with them. Chapter two slides and codes are from them. The workshop was three hours long, for 12 students using Windows computers.
